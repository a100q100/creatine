Creatine
========

CreateJS is a great suite of libraries that is used for interactive 
applications. One of these libraries is EaselJS, used as an interface for the 
HTML5 canvas element. Other libraries include PreloaderJS, SoundJS, and 
TweenJS. Despite its awesomeness, these libraries do not focus on game 
development, thus, do not provide important structures and algorithms commonly 
used on games.

Creatine gives that power up to CreateJS, providing structures and algorithms 
to scene management, scene transitions, layout management, and a lot more.
