Creatine
========

CreateJS is a great suite of libraries that is used for interactive 
applications. One of these libraries is EaselJS, used as an interface for the 
HTML5 canvas element. Other libraries include PreloaderJS, SoundJS, and 
TweenJS. Despite its awesomeness, these libraries do not focus on game 
development, thus, do not provide important structures and algorithms commonly 
used on games.

**Creatine** gives that power up to CreateJS, providing structures and 
algorithms to scene management, scene transitions, layout management, and a lot
more.
