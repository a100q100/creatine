# Creatine

Creatine is a power-up to the CreateJS libraries, providing data structures and algorithms for game development. You will see here:

- **Scene management** - *with scene stacks based on Cocos2D Director*
- **Scene transitions** - *you can also create new transitions*
- **Input handling** - *keyboard, mouse, touch and gamepads*
- **Resources and Factories** - *facilitates the access to PreloadJS*
- **Sound handling** - *facilitates the access to SoundJS*
- **Storage helper** - *easy use of localStorage*
- **Plugins** - *create and install plugins that work together with the engine*
- **Particles** - *a fast particle system for canvas*
- **Tile Maps** - *total integration with Tiled, supporting all map projections*

Feel free to use, modify, improve, make additions and suggestions.

## Note on Creatine 1.0.0

For creatine 1.0.0 and next releases, I'm trying to keep things more data-driven. So it can be easily extended by a visual editor or other 3th-party editors.
