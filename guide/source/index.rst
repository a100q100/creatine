===================
Creatine User Guide
===================

CreateJS is a great suite of libraries that is used for interactive applications. One of these libraries is EaselJS, used as an interface for the HTML5 canvas element. Other libraries include PreloaderJS, SoundJS, and TweenJS. Despite its awesomeness, these libraries do not focus on game development, thus, do not provide important structures and algorithms commonly used on games.

Creatine gives that power up to CreateJS, providing structures and algorithms to scene management, scene transitions, layout management, and a lot more. This is the official user guide to Creatine, and it describes some important features of the library.
